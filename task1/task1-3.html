<article>
    <h3>Chamomile is an herb that belongs to the Asteraceae (daisy or sunflower) plant family and is grown around the world. 
        It forms a daisylike flower with small white petals, a yellow center, and a thin stem, and can grow nearly 3 feet high
    Chamomile has been used as a traditional medicine for thousands of years to calm anxiety and settle stomachs. People in ancient Rome,
     Greece, and Egypt used dried chamomile flowers and their essential oils as a medicinal herb.</h3>

    <h2>Chamomile Benefits   </h2>
    <h4>
        There's not much solid research into chamomile's benefits. There's some evidence it could ease anxiety and maybe even help you sleep better. But we need more research, especially because many of the studies done so far have combined chamomile with other ingredients.

        Still, chamomile is generally considered safe. Historically, people have used it for:
    <ol>
        <li>Chest colds</li>
        <li>Fever</li>
        <li>Gum inflammation (gingivitis) and canker sores</li>
        <li>Sore throats</li>
        <li>Hemorrhoids</li>
        <li>Acid reflux</li>
        <li>Diarrhea</li>
    </ol>

 Chamomile Dosage

Chamomile comes in many forms, so there's no standard recommended dosage.     
Talk to your doctor before you use chamomile if you have any health conditions, take medication, or are pregnant or nursing. It could interact with drugs or other supplements you take.  
 Always ask your pediatrician before giving chamomile in any form to infants or children.

Chamomile tea

 Tea is the most common way to use the herb. Many people drink a cup after a meal to aid digestion and soothe stomach troubles.
 To make chamomile tea, steep a chamomile tea bag in about 8 ounces of hot water for 5-10 minutes in a mug covered with a saucer.
 To use dried chamomile flowers, place them in a tea infuser or tea ball.         
Add honey or lemon juice to add more flavor. Then, sip your tea when it has cooled to a safe temperature.
